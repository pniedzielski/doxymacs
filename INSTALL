Doxymacs does not depend on any external packages by default; you can use it
with any Emacsen.  To use doxymacs:

- Put (require 'doxymacs) in your .emacs

- Customise the variable doxymacs-doxygen-dirs.
  Doxymacs customisation can be done from the Options | Customize menu,
  under Emacs | Programming | Tools | Doxymacs.

- Invoke doxymacs-mode with M-x doxymacs-mode. To have doxymacs-mode invoked
  automatically when in C/C++ mode, put 

  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'doxymacs-mode) 

  in your .emacs.

- If you want Doxygen keywords fontified use M-x doxymacs-font-lock.
  To do it automatically, add the following to your .emacs:

  (defun my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook ()
    (if (or (eq major-mode 'c-mode) (eq major-mode 'c++-mode))
        (doxymacs-font-lock)))
  (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook 'my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook)

  This will add the Doxygen keywords to c-mode and c++-mode only.

- Default key bindings are:
  - C-c d ? will look up documentation for the symbol under the point.
  - C-c d r will rescan your Doxygen tags file.
  - C-c d RET will prompt you for a Doxygen command to enter, and its
    arguments.
  - C-c d f will insert a Doxygen comment for the next function.
  - C-c d i will insert a Doxygen comment for the current file.
  - C-c d ; will insert a Doxygen comment for the current member.
  - C-c d m will insert a blank multi-line Doxygen comment.
  - C-c d s will insert a blank single-line Doxygen comment.
  - C-c d @ will insert grouping comments around the current region.

Doxymacs comes with an external parser for Doxygen tags files written in C.  If
your tags file is quite large (say, > 1 MB), you may find the external parser
to be more performant.  The external parser depends on the following packages:

- autotools https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
- pkg-config https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/
- libxml2 http://www.libxml.org/

Be sure these are properly configured and installed before proceeding.

- Use the bootstrap script to generate the parserâ€™s build system, if
  `c/configure` does not already exist

   $ cd c
   $ ./bootstrap

- Use the configure script to configure the external parser:

   $ cd c
   $ ./configure
   $ make

- Set doxymacs-use-external-xml-parser to t and be sure to set
  doxymacs-external-xml-parser-executable to the path of the compiled external
  parser.  With an 11 MB XML tag file, the internal process takes 20 minutes on
  a PIII 800 with 1 GB of RAM, whereas the external process takes 12 seconds.
