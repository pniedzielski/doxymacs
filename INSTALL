Doxymacs depends on the following packages:

- W3      http://www.cs.indiana.edu/usr/local/www/elisp/w3/docs.html
- tempo   http://www.lysator.liu.se/~davidk/elisp/
- libxml2 http://www.libxml.org/

Be sure these are properly configured and installed before proceeding.

- The project can be used as is, but you can use the Makefile provided
to compile the *.el files into *.elc and the doxymacs_parser.c into a
binary executable.

To use as is, execute:
  $ make install
To compile only the doxymacs_parser.c, execute:
  $ make c
To compile only the emacs lisp files, execute:
  $ make elisp
And finally to build all, you can either execute:
  $ make
or
  $ make all

After building, you may install using
  $ make install

There also exists
  $ make clean
which removes built files to clean the repository.

Building for XEmacs using this Makefile has not been tested. 

- If your tags file is quite large (say, > 1 MB), consider setting
  doxymacs-use-external-xml-parser to t and be sure to set
  doxymacs-external-xml-parser-executable to the right value (the
  default should usually be fine).  A suitable program is distributed
  in the directory doxymacs.  With an 11 MB XML tag file, the
  internal process takes 20 minutes on a PIII 800 with 1 GB of RAM,
  whereas the external process takes 12 seconds.

- Put (require 'doxymacs) in your .emacs

- Invoke doxymacs-mode with M-x doxymacs-mode. To have doxymacs-mode invoked
  automatically when in C/C++ mode, put 

  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'doxymacs-mode) 

  in your .emacs.

- If you want Doxygen keywords fontified use M-x doxymacs-font-lock.
  To do it automatically, add the following to your .emacs:

  (defun my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook ()
    (if (or (eq major-mode 'c-mode) (eq major-mode 'c++-mode))
        (doxymacs-font-lock)))
  (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook 'my-doxymacs-font-lock-hook)

  This will add the Doxygen keywords to c-mode and c++-mode only.

- Default key bindings are:
  - C-c d ? will look up documentation for the symbol under the point.
  - C-c d r will rescan your Doxygen tags file.
  - C-c d RET will prompt you for a Doxygen command to enter, and its
    arguments.
  - C-c d f will insert a Doxygen comment for the next function.
  - C-c d i will insert a Doxygen comment for the current file.
  - C-c d ; will insert a Doxygen comment for the current member.
  - C-c d m will insert a blank multi-line Doxygen comment.
  - C-c d s will insert a blank single-line Doxygen comment.
  - C-c d @ will insert grouping comments around the current region.
